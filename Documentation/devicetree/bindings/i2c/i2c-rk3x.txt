* Rockchip RK3xxx I2C controller

Required properties :

 - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
 - compatible : should be "rockchip,rk3x-i2c"
 - interrupts : interrupt number
 - clocks : parent clock which in the end determines SCL rate
 - grf : the phandle of the syscon node for the general register file (GRF)
 - bus-idx : index of the bus in the GRF

Example:
	i2c0: i2c@2002d000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3x-i2c";
		reg = <0x2002d000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 40 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		grf = <&grf>;
		bus-idx = <0>;

		clock-names = "i2c";
		clocks = <&cru PCLK_I2C0>;
	};
